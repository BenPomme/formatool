# Font Detection Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-10-06

## Test Summary
After implementing the user's fixes to the font detection system, I conducted comprehensive testing of the document formatting application.

## Test Results

### API Test Results
When testing the `/api/dual/upload-dual` endpoint with SOLSTOR IBERIA.docx:

**Response Data:**
- Session ID: Successfully generated
- Style Extraction Success: True
- Confidence: 85%
- **Raw DOCX Styles: NOT INCLUDED IN RESPONSE** ‚ùå
- Simplified Styles:
  - Font: Calibri (appears to be fallback/default)
  - Font Size: 11
  - Colors: Correctly extracted (#000000, #0F4761, #FFFFFF)

### Critical Issue Found
The `rawDocxStyles` object is not being included in the API response from `/src/routes/uploadDual.ts`, even though it should be according to lines 132 of that file. This is why the frontend cannot display the actual fonts from the document.

### Backend Behavior
The backend server logs show:
```
üìÅ Received dual upload:
   Reference: SOLSTOR IBERIA.docx (223101 bytes)
   Target: 54a9c42b-cc48-4612-8ff6-ee5cadff8563.docx (223101 bytes)
üé® Extracting styles from reference document: SOLSTOR IBERIA.docx
POST /api/dual/upload-dual 200 5033.890 ms
```

No error logs or font extraction details are visible in the console output.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The `rawDocxStyles` data is not being passed from the StyleExtractor service to the API response. Looking at the code:

1. **StyleExtractor.ts** - Has the capability to extract raw DOCX styles
2. **uploadDual.ts (line 132)** - Attempts to include `rawDocxStyles: styleResult.rawDocxStyles`
3. **API Response** - `rawDocxStyles` is missing/undefined

### Likely Cause
The `styleResult` object returned from `styleExtractor.extractStyles()` does not contain a `rawDocxStyles` property, or it's not being properly populated during the extraction process.

## Verification Steps Taken

1. ‚úÖ Started backend server on port 3001
2. ‚úÖ Started frontend server on port 5174
3. ‚úÖ Tested API endpoint with curl and Python script
4. ‚úÖ Verified API response structure
5. ‚úÖ Checked backend logs for extraction details
6. ‚ùå Could not manually test UI file upload (browser security restrictions)

## Current State
- Colors are being extracted correctly
- Font sizes are being extracted
- **Font names are NOT being displayed** - showing "Calibri" instead of actual document fonts
- The UI would show blank/missing fonts if it relied on `rawDocxStyles` since it's not in the API response

## Recommended Fix

The `StyleExtractor.extractStyles()` method needs to be modified to ensure it returns the `rawDocxStyles` object. The issue is likely in `/src/services/styleExtractor.ts` where the return object should include:

```typescript
return {
  success: true,
  confidence: confidence,
  simplified: simplifiedStyles,
  rawDocxStyles: this.rawDocxStyles, // This line may be missing
  // ... other properties
};
```

## Files That Need Review

1. `/src/services/styleExtractor.ts` - Ensure `extractStyles()` returns `rawDocxStyles`
2. `/src/routes/uploadDual.ts` - Verify it's correctly accessing the returned data
3. `/src/services/docxStyleExtractor.ts` - Confirm it's properly extracting fonts

## Conclusion

The font detection is still not working despite the user's fixes. The core issue is that `rawDocxStyles` is not being included in the API response, preventing the frontend from displaying the actual extracted fonts. The system falls back to showing "Calibri" as a default value instead of the real fonts from the document.

## Table Detection & Formatting Status (2025-01-29)

### Completed Work
- Replaced the brittle, ad‚Äëhoc table parsing inside `localFormattingEngine`, `semanticPostProcessor`, and `structuredFormatter` with a shared helper (`src/utils/tableUtils.ts`).  
- Local structure detection now groups tab- and space-aligned rows into a single `table` element instead of misclassifying them as headings or paragraphs.  
- Local formatting converts detected tables to Markdown pipe syntax so the structured preview can render grid lines.  
- DOCX export transforms any detected table into a real `docx.Table` with borders, alternating row shading, and cell padding; the exported file finally shows visual table borders.  
- Semantic post-processing uses the shared parser to populate `tableData`, ensuring previews and downloads stay in sync even when the AI returns flattened text.

### Outstanding Issues / Follow-up
- The Markdown preview still renders via HTML markup; confirm that the new grid styling meets UX expectations once the frontend rebuilds.  
- The AI-only pipeline (without hybrid mode) still relies on OpenAI output fidelity‚Äîrun an end-to-end test to verify tables survive the round trip.  
- No automated regression exists yet. Plan to add a Jest test that feeds the `tableUtils.parseTableFromText` sample and asserts column integrity, plus a formatter snapshot to guard against future regressions.

### Next Steps
1. Draft the Jest regression test described above.  
2. Smoke-test the `/export` DOCX route with multiple tables to validate border sizing and alignment.  
3. Coordinate with the frontend team to double-check how Markdown tables are rendered in the app‚Äôs preview pane.*** End Patch
