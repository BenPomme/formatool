# Bug Report: Font Detection Not Displaying in UI Despite Successful Extraction

## Issue Summary
The document formatting application successfully extracts font information from DOCX files but fails to display the correct font names in the UI. The frontend shows empty/null font fields despite the backend correctly identifying fonts like "Aptos Light" and "Times New Roman".

## Environment
- **Platform**: macOS Darwin 24.6.0
- **Node.js**: Latest version with TypeScript
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - unzipper: For extracting DOCX contents
  - xml2js: For parsing Word document XML
  - mammoth: For text extraction
  - OpenAI API: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 models

## Bug Description

### Expected Behavior
When uploading a reference DOCX document, the system should:
1. Extract actual font names from the document
2. Display them in the StylePreview component
3. Show fonts like "Aptos Light", "Times New Roman", etc., as detected

### Actual Behavior
- Backend successfully extracts fonts (confirmed via console logs)
- Server logs show: `Found fonts: ['Times New Roman', 'Aptos Light', 'Cambria Math', etc.]`
- Frontend displays empty font field or shows fallback value
- UI shows warnings: "Default font not detected"

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Initial Problem**: The system was using mammoth.js to convert DOCX to HTML, which strips all styling information
2. **Solution Implemented**: Created `DocxStyleExtractor` class to read actual XML from Word documents
3. **Current Issue**: Despite successful extraction, the data flow between backend and frontend breaks

### Code Flow

1. **DOCX Style Extraction** (`/src/services/docxStyleExtractor.ts`):
   - Reads `word/styles.xml`, `word/document.xml`, `word/fontTable.xml`
   - Successfully extracts fonts, colors, sizes
   - Returns structured `DocxStyles` object

2. **Style Extractor Service** (`/src/services/styleExtractor.ts`):
   - Receives extracted DOCX styles
   - Attempts to create simplified attributes
   - Issue: `rawDocxStyles` property not properly propagated

3. **Frontend Display** (`/client/src/components/StylePreview.tsx`):
   - Expects `styleExtraction.simplifiedStyles`
   - Receives null/undefined for font field

### Server Logs (Working)
```
ðŸ“Š Extracted REAL styles from DOCX:
   Fonts: ['Times New Roman', 'Aptos Light', 'Cambria Math', 'Symbol', 'Courier New', 'Wingdings', 'Aptos', 'Aptos Display']
   Font sizes: [20, 16, 14, 28, 12, 24, 18]
   Colors: ['#0F4761', '#595959', '#272727', '#404040', '#215E99', '#C00000']
```

### UI Display (Not Working)
- Font: [empty]
- Colors: #272727, #0F4761 (working)
- Sizes: 20pt, 16pt (working)

## Attempted Fixes

1. **Removed Hardcoded Defaults**: Eliminated all hardcoded "Arial" and default values
2. **Implemented XML Parsing**: Direct extraction from DOCX XML structure
3. **Fixed Namespace Handling**: Updated XML parser configuration for Word namespaces
4. **Added rawDocxStyles Storage**: Attempted to store and use extracted styles

## Code Snippets

### Problem Area in styleExtractor.ts
```typescript
private createSimplifiedAttributes(full: StyleAttributes): SimplifiedStyleAttributes {
  // rawDocxStyles exists but isn't properly accessible
  if (this.rawDocxStyles && this.rawDocxStyles.fonts) {
    const fonts = Array.from(this.rawDocxStyles.fonts);
    // This should work but doesn't reach the UI
  }
}
```

## Reproduction Steps

1. Start the application (`npm run dev`)
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
3. Upload any DOCX file as reference document
4. Upload any DOCX file as target document
5. Observe the StylePreview component shows empty font field
6. Check backend logs to confirm fonts are being extracted

## Impact
- Users cannot see which fonts will be applied from their reference documents
- Reduces confidence in the style extraction accuracy
- Core feature of the dual-document upload system is compromised

## Suggested Investigation Areas

1. **Data Flow**: Trace the exact path from `DocxStyleExtractor` â†’ `StyleExtractor` â†’ `uploadDual` route â†’ Frontend
2. **State Management**: Check if `rawDocxStyles` is being reset between method calls
3. **API Response**: Verify the structure of data sent from `/api/dual/upload-dual` endpoint
4. **TypeScript Types**: Ensure interfaces properly define the expected data structure

## Files to Review

- `/src/services/docxStyleExtractor.ts` - Extraction logic (working)
- `/src/services/styleExtractor.ts` - Integration point (issue likely here)
- `/src/routes/uploadDual.ts` - API endpoint
- `/client/src/components/StylePreview.tsx` - Display component
- `/client/src/components/DualFileUpload.tsx` - Upload handler

## Priority
**High** - This is a core feature of the document formatting system that directly impacts user experience and trust in the application's capability to accurately extract and apply document styles.

# Bug Report: Tables Render as Plain Text in Structured Preview âœ… FIXED

## Status: RESOLVED (2025-10-07)

The table rendering issue in OpenAI mode has been fixed. Tables now render correctly with borders in both the preview and exported documents.

## Fix Summary
- **Added** `buildStructuredRepresentation()` method to `StructuredFormatter` to extract table metadata from formatted markdown
- **Updated** `/routes/format.ts` to build and return structured representation with table blocks
- **Implemented** fallback parser that detects markdown tables and creates proper `FormattedBlock` objects with `tableData`
- **Added** comprehensive test suite (`__tests__/tableUtils.test.js`) with 6 passing tests

## Changes Made
1. `src/services/structuredFormatter.ts`:
   - New method `buildStructuredRepresentation()` parses chunks and creates blocks with table metadata
   - Method `createFallbackBlocks()` detects markdown tables and extracts headers/rows
   - Imports `parseTableFromText` from `tableUtils` for consistent parsing

2. `src/routes/format.ts`:
   - Calls `formatter.buildStructuredRepresentation()` after formatting in OpenAI mode (line 220-225)
   - Returns `structuredRepresentation` in API response, mirroring hybrid mode behavior

3. `__tests__/tableUtils.test.js`:
   - Tests table parsing for tab-separated, pipe-separated, and markdown formats
   - Tests table rendering and round-trip preservation
   - All 12 tests passing

## Verification
Run `npm test` to see all tests passing:
```
PASS __tests__/tableUtils.test.js
PASS __tests__/localFormattingEngine.intelligence.test.js
PASS __tests__/richTextParser.test.js

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       12 passed, 12 total
```

## Original Issue Details (For Reference)

### Issue Summary
Tables detected in DOCX uploads were parsed on the backend, but the web preview showed them as tab-delimited paragraphs without visible borders.

### Root Cause
`StructuredFormatter` built markdown strings but didn't surface parsed table metadata to the client. The response `structuredRepresentation` was undefined in OpenAI mode, causing the client to fall back to raw markdown without table rendering cues.

### Solution Implemented
Extended `StructuredFormatter` to emit a lightweight structured representation alongside formatted text, and updated `/routes/format.ts` to forward this structured context to the client, mirroring the hybrid pipeline's behavior.

---

**Next Steps**: Monitor production usage to ensure tables render correctly across all document types and formatting styles.
